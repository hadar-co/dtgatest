Below is a structured guide for ingesting Cloud Resources using New Relic, formatted similarly to other guides available on docs.getport.io/guides. \n\n---\n\n# Ingest Cloud Resources using New Relic\n\n## Introduction\nThis guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to ingest cloud resources into your system using New Relic. You will learn about the necessary Port components such as blueprints, mappings, and how to set everything up effectively.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n- A New Relic account with API access.\n- Port IDP set up and configured.\n- Required permissions to create blueprints and mappings in your Port environment.\n\n## Steps to Ingest Cloud Resources\n\n### Step 1: Create a Blueprint\nBlueprints define the structure for the resources you want to ingest. To create a blueprint for cloud resources, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Go to the Blueprints Section:**\n   Navigate to the blueprints section in your Port dashboard.\n\n2. **Define the Blueprint:**\n   Create a new blueprint and fill in the necessary fields. Ensure that your blueprint includes:\n   - Resource type\n   - API endpoint\n   - Authentication details\n\n**Example Blueprint JSON:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"cloud-resource-blueprint\",\n  \"type\": \"blueprint\",\n  \"resources\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"AWS EC2\",\n      \"type\": \"cloud\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n        \"instanceType\": \"t2.micro\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Mapping\nMappings define how the data from New Relic will be transformed and ingested into your system. Here's how to create a mapping:\n\n1. **Go to the Mappings Section:**\n   Navigate to the mappings section in your Port dashboard.\n\n2. **Define the Mapping:**\n   Create a new mapping that corresponds to the previously defined blueprint. Ensure it correctly links the attributes of the New Relic data to your resource attributes.\n\n**Example Mapping JSON:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"cloud-resource-mapping\",\n  \"type\": \"mapping\",\n  \"source\": \"new_relic\",\n  \"target\": {\n    \"id\": \"cloud-resource-blueprint\",\n    \"type\": \"blueprint\"\n  },\n  \"transformations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"instance.id\",\n      \"target\": \"id\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"instance.type\",\n      \"target\": \"attributes.instanceType\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure New Relic Integration\nTo ingest data from New Relic, set up the integration by following these steps:\n\n1. **API Key:**\n   Generate an API key in New Relic and store it securely.\n\n2. **Ingest Configuration:**\n   Configure the ingestion job in your Port dashboard to pull data from New Relic at specified intervals. Input the necessary credentials and endpoint details.\n\n**Example Ingestion Configuration:**\n```yaml\ningestion:\n  source: new_relic\n  apiKey: \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY\"\n  endpoint: \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/cloud_resources.json\"\n  schedule: \"*/5 * * * *\"  # Every 5 minutes\n```\n\n### Step 4: Validate the Ingestion\nAfter setting up the blueprints, mappings, and integration, you need to validate that the data is correctly ingested into your system:\n\n1. **Review the Logs:**\n   Check the ingestion logs for any errors or warnings.\n\n2. **Verify the Resources:**\n   Go to the resources section of your Port dashboard and ensure that the cloud resources are populated as expected.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps, you should now be able to successfully ingest cloud resources from New Relic into your system. For further customization and advanced configurations, please refer to additional documentation or support channels.\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [API Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/)\n- [Port IDP Tutorials](https://docs.getport.io/guides)\n- [New Relic Community](https://discuss.newrelic.com/)\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adapt or expand upon this guide to suit your specific needs or requirements!",
